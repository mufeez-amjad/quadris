To build the project, run qmake followed by make.

To quit the application, the command "quit" can be used, or any shortest prefix uniquely identifying "quit". Quitting the application must be
done through console input.

Random test scripts can be generated by running "python3 gen_tests.py".

# Bonus Features

To enable bonus features, invoke ./quadris with the flag "-bonus" passed as a command line argument.

## Inexplicit memory management
This bonus feature comes from the Assignment Specification and Guidelines. All of the heap memory used by Quadris is managed using smart pointers and STL vector containers. As a result, we have no explicit delete statements.

## Graphical User Interface Input
The GUI display accepts button input for commands. In addition, the keyboard keys ASD can be used for block movement (left, down, and right), the arrow keys can be used to rotate a block clockwise and counter-clockwise, and the space bar can be used to drop blocks.

## Multithreading
In order to facilitate receiving non-blocking input from the Graphical Display simultaneously with reading input from the Console, we had to incorporate multithreading using mutex locks to ensure thread safety.
